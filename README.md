# Smart-Blockchain

## Introduction
Ten years ago, Bitcoin’s proof-of-work mechanism was a great
idea for a pilot project and the launch of the first decentralized
network as well. But this approach for long-term must be
corrected, and for years, the amount of power consumed ( more
than 50TWh per year ) by a country with ten million populations,
cannot be dedicated for bitcoin transactions only. It’s extreme
selfishness and not fair

The research published in Nature Climate Change (October 2018)
even suggested that Bitcoin mining alone could push global
warming “above 2 °C within less than three decades“. The
electricity consumption of the proof-of-work mechanism used in
the bitcoin network is huge. Meanwhile, a major share of mining
operations is done with electricity from coal-fired power plants in
China, cause increasing Bitcoin’s environmental problems and
blockchain technology

Smart Blockchain is the new generation of Blockchain networks
that will allow one or more smart contracts to collect accurate and
flawless data from the successful transactions of a decentralized
network at the moment of transaction occurrence, and
simultaneously storing and registering these data in new blocks.
Smart Blockchain needs neither the financial institution nor
intermediary, in addition, there will be no task to do for miners and
block producers in this technology. In other words, within Smart
Blockchain, always one or more smart contracts like a financial
institution, free of charge and automatically record and store
transactions ‘data in new blocks.

## How does Smart Blockchain work?
In Smart Blockchain, one or more Block Producer Smart Contract
(BPSC) is present in the decentralized network, and no successful
transaction is performed without BPSC involvement. For a
successful transaction in the network, first, the sender must send
the cryptocurrency to the wallet of BPSC and then BPSC sends
cryptocurrency automatically to the receiver. This simple action
has led the BPSC to have all network transactions’ data accurately
and flawlessly and then as an accurate and trust financial
institution, record transactions’ data into a new block and add this
new block to the end of the blockchain and so there will be no
tasks to assign to miners and block producers.
